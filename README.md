# Summary of the project
 
 I used Python and NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), a genetic algorithm, to create an artificial intelligence that learns how to play an Air Raid like game.


 The rules of the game:
 - get a point for every alien ship destroyed 
 - lose if you let 15 alien ships pass by or the ship touches an alien ship


 The performance of the AI:

 Generation 0-1: unable to understand how to move and shoot properly

Generation 7: starting to learn where and when to shoot and almost destroys every alien ship
